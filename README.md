MiniFS
======

MiniFS project for course ID1020: https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/ID1020?l=en.

We were tasked with designing a heirarcical mini filesystem that would implement some of the basic file system functions in Unix/Linux.

Supported features would be:
* mkdir
* touch
* ls [-s] [-t]
* du
* append
* cat
* rm

I decided to also add support for a working directory and relative paths, thus my filesystem also supports cd and pwd.
